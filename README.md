OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:Exploratory Python Programming on Student Grade Tracker

OBJECTIVE
The code is a simple student grade tracker program written in Python. It takes input for marks in five subjects (Maths, English, Hindi, Physics, and Biology), calculates the total marks and average marks, and then assigns a grade based on the average marks. Here are some good aspects of the code.
*KEY ACTIVITIES
1. User Input
The code prompts the user to enter marks for five subjects: Maths, English, Hindi, Physics, and Biology.
The input() function is used to capture the user's input for each subject.
The input marks are converted to integers using the int() function.
2. Calculation of Total Marks
The code calculates the total marks by adding up the marks for all five subjects.
The total marks are displayed along with the maximum possible marks (500).
3. Calculation of Average Marks
The code calculates the average marks by dividing the total marks by the number of subjects (5).
The average marks are stored in the AVG_MARKS variable.
